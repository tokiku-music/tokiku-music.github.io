I'm just a regular internet-using human who happens to enjoy video games and music. I created this website to share my personal music arrangements with others who might find them useful.

I have the most experience with piano (which is consequently what I'm most comfortable making arrangements for), but I have also played various string and woodwind instruments as well. I may branch outside of piano arrangements eventually, especially if there's high enough demand, but for now piano is my instrument of focus.

Feel free to visit my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@Tokiku_){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} page for Synthesia-type tutorial videos, or message me there if you want to contact me for any reason.

Enjoy!
